# Analysis and  Findings

The accompanying **pie** graph shows the percentage of reservations that are canceled and those that are not. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of reservations that have not been canceled. There are still 37% of clients who canceled their rerservation, which has a significant impact on the hotel's earnings

We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. Asww can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled reservations are largest in the month of August, whereas January is the month with the most canceled reservations.

Now, let's see which country has the highest reservation canceled. The top country is Portugal with the highest number of cancellations

In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It's possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in cities.

This plot clearly shows that prices in the Resort Hotel are much higher during the summer and the cancellation is also very high during this period of time and prices of city hotel varies less and is most expensive during Spring and Autumn.

From this pie chart we can clearly see that if there are no parking space avalable then there is 43% chance that the parsion will canceled the booking but if atleast one parking lot is present then the probability of cancelation become zero which is
very good for every hotel.

# Suggestions
1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing stategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a resonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
3. The Hotel authority must focus to provide parking lot to reduce the cancelation rate in a significant rate
4. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
5. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate
